# C Simple Small-C Compiler

An implementation of an Small-C compiler for the Compiler course.

## Grammar
The grammar accepted by the compiler is on the repository with the source code. [here](https://github.com/elvishribeiro/SmallC-Compiler/tree/master/Csmall)

## Building
To compile just type the following

```Shell
$ make
```

## Running
Running is as simple as building
```Shell
$ ./main arg
```
- `arg` can be either a file or a path. In the case of a path the compiler will compile all the .c files in there
